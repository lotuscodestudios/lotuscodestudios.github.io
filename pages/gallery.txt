                    Impression by rae is a Beauty, Personal care, and
                    Health Products brand.
                    The Nude color was used to represent the neutrality in which 
                    the brand pursues in having a healthy skin, the color were derived in monochromatic 
                    combinations to potray a neutral quality.
                    The creative design was applied to derive the brands symbol as monograms were combined
                    with organic shapes to form the shape of an oil which is a key ingredient in every skincare product.
