       <p>

        Air Force Military School, Jos (AFMS) is a military and academic institution located in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. Established on 18 September 1980, the school has graduated over 7,000 junior airmen as of July 2017. 
        The school is effectively a military institution (part of the Nigerian Air Force) that provides both normal secondary school education and military training to Nigerian boys aged around 11 to 17 years. Students on the one hand 
        receive education in subjects like mathematics, physics, geography, and French, and on the other hand get trained in military weaponry and tactics. The military training seems geared to encourage a career in the Nigerian armed forces and many graduates 
        have gone on to become commissioned officers in the army, air force, and navy.
